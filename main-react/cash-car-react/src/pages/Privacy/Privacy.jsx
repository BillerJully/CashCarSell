            <p>
                We may collect cookies and IP addresses from you. Cookies are
                small files that a site or its service provider transfers to
                your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser (if you
                allow) that enables the sites or service providers’ systems to
                recognize your browser and capture and remember certain
                information. With this information we can implement more
                advanced options into your account, further customizing your
                experience. For example, cookies have the ability to store your
                login information so that you could access your account
                immediately. These types of information may be aggregated and
                generalized, meaning there is no way to track a cookie back to
                you. With this information we’re analyzing how much people use
                our site and looking for more ways to improve user experiences.
                We continually strive to improve our website offerings based on
                the information and feedback we receive from you so we can more
                effectively respond to your customer service requests and
                support needs.
